This project is a fork of the original [ng-s3upload github repo](https://github.com/asafdav/ng-s3upload) from Asaf David. It adds HTML5 mobile friendly syntaxis for file validation, thanks to Francesco Iovine [media capture example](http://www.francesco.iovine.name/w3c/mediacapture/)

## Download Options

```
bower install ng-s3upload-mobile

npm install ng-s3upload-mobile
```

1. Setup your AWS S3 bucket

Please refer to [this github repo](https://github.com/asafdav/ng-s3upload)

2. Create a server side service that will return the needed details for uploading files to S3.
your service shall return a json in the following format: 

  ```json
  {
   "policy": "XXXX",
   "signature": "YYY",
   "key": "ZZZ"
  }
  ```
XXX - A policy json that is required by AWS, base64 encoded.
